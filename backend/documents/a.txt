FUP
What is FUP?
Fair Usage Policy or FUP is practiced by ISPs worldwide whereby it allows ISPs to restrict or throttle Internet Speeds on unlimited plans to prevent misuse or excessive use of bandwidth provided. FUP is implemented with the intent of protecting the ISP's ability to provide quality internet services to all of their customers and to ensure no customers are disadvantaged by the behavior of others.
Providing unlimited Internet service increases the risk of few customers abusing service and using most of the ISP's bandwidth which makes it difficult for ISPs to maintain quality for other customers who have moderate usage and are paying an equal amount of money. To prevent this ISP throttle or restrict speeds of customers who have excessive usage to maintain fair usage amongst all of its customers.
How does a user fall under FUP?
Fair Usage Policy in Classic Tech is conventionally used for proper welfare and benefits for customers. Typically, FUP is used under those circumstances where a customer uses heavy data and fills up the allocated bandwidth and making the overall experience inappropriate for other users on the same network while browsing, downloading, and gaming. Classic Tech ensures to provide the best quality internet service to our customers, where the security and privacy of our customers are protected.
What happens when a user is under the influence of FUP?
If a user is under influence of FUP the user will experience a slow internet connection while browsing or let’s say subscribed bandwidth will be throttled as per the ISP’s rules and policy.
What factors cause the customer to fall under FUP? How to avoid FUP?
Classic-Tech all unlimited share plans are subjected to FUP. Most of the cases that cause FUP for a subscriber having a “Home Plan” can be:
If a user is using a “Home Plan” service for official use (for example Hostel, Cyber & Official work). Supposedly, in official use, most of the files that are downloaded and uploaded are popularized as heavy files where the use of internet bandwidth will be automatically restricted after filling up available bandwidth.
If a customer using “Home Plan” has an unusual or heavy download.
If a customer having “Home Plan” has shared a secondary link with multiple users consuming high data.
Viruses and Malicious can easily hijack devices to send and receive data without even knowing.
Subscribing to an appropriate internet plan is the best way to avoid FUP restrictions. A user can avoid FUP by keeping track of Download and Upload speed regularly. Also taking control over massive download and sharing.
How FUP works in Classic Tech?
In Classic Tech we have a Classic FUP system, which monitors our user’s behavior, when a user exceeds the monthly data threshold, Zone will be tagged automatically, and based on ZONE tagged, our system automatically restricts those abusers and keeps the overall experience balanced for normal users.
How does the ZONE system work in Classic Tech?
The Classic Tech system automatically checks on a user's data usage and triggers the FUP zone if a user crosses the daily download limit. ZONES are categorized into three different types 1. YELLOW Zone 2. RED Zone & 3. BLACK Zone
How does each zone work and what happens if a user is tagged by each zone?
As we know, zones are triggered automatically and three zones of speed throttling are done depending on the client’s usage within a monthly billing cycle.
YELLOW Zone: Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
RED Zone: Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
BLACK Zone: Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled to 5Mbps; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
If a customer has crossed the FUP Quota threshold, their data usage counter will reset at the first of every monthly billing cycle and their Internet will return to its original speed.
How to restart and remove FUP?
The replenishment sequence of the Data Allowance is based upon 30 days (month). At the start of the next monthly billing cycle, the customer’s subscribed speed & data transfer limit is automatically being restored as per the plan subscribed.
Other than this customers can also consider upgrading their plan to get higher Fair Usage Quotas or subscribe to our SOHO (Small Office and Home office) plans which have no Fair Usage Quota.

How can I shift my internet service to another location either within the same house or in a new location?
Please kindly contact us to move Classic Tech Internet to a different location either within the same house or to a new location.
Fiber cable used to supply Internet to your location needs to be handled by Fiber Technicians so that the issue may not arise. Fiber cables are made of glass, unlike normal electric cables which can be damaged if bent and needs to be handled with care.
Certain charges are applied for the relocation of devices. Charges vary accordingly to the use of Fiber Cable. If no new fiber cable is required the charge for relocation devices is Rs. 500 +VAT. If a new fiber cable is used, which is the case for relocation in a different location, the relocation charges are Rs. 500 + VAT and Rs. 8 per meter of fiber. [CAT6 is available at Rs. 30 per meter.]
We request customers to inform us at least 7 days before relocating to a new location.

It depends on how many users are connected to the respective Router. If users from the secondary router consume More bandwidth, then it will affect the primary one.
Dual Band 5GHz ONU
What do you mean by dual-band ONU?
Dual-band ONU Provides 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz dual-band wireless signals which support the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac wireless network. Dual-band wifi belongs to the fifth generation Wi-Fi transmission technology (5GWi-Fi).
The dual-band WiFi refers to the wireless signal that supports two different bands at the same time. These two bands are 2.4 and 5 G respectively.
At present, most wireless products adopt single-frequency 2.4G WiFi wireless transmission, such as a wireless mouse, keyboard, USB wireless network card, ordinary wireless router, and so on. Only high-end smart devices support dual-band WiFi technology, such as "some ONU, some mobile phones, tablets, high-end wireless routers" and so on.
What is the advantage of dual-band WiFi?
The 2.4G band signal has relatively good penetration and a relatively long coverage distance. But there are too many devices with 2.4G. At present, in the family environment, the average number of 2.4GAPs (Wireless Access Point) that a family can search around has exceeded 5. The environment of 2.4G is becoming more and more noisy and disturbing.
Why is 5G WiFi more stable and faster than 2.4G wifi? The 2.4G only provides three channels signal which does not interfere with each other. 5G can provide 22 channels signals. On another point, there are only a few devices with 5G wifi signals. So, 5G channels are clean and faster. In the case of transmitting the same amount of data, 5G will save electricity and have a better user experience.
What is the advantage of dual-band ONU?
Dual-band wifi ONU can support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency at the same time. Dual-band wifi ONU has both advantages of 2.4G and 5G, which not only provide good penetration and relatively long coverage distance 2.4G wifi signal but also provide clean and much faster 5G wifi signal.
Why should I use Dual Band ONU?
If the Package is above 100 Mbps we suggest you use dual-band ONU because single band 2.4Ghz ONU accepts only up to 100-125 Mbps speed. And also, for better performance of the internet such as uninterrupted Video calling, Online classes, Online Gaming, etc.
Does this support all of my gadgets?
Your gadgets must support Wireless 802.11 ac. But Dual-band provides 2.4Ghz also so that you can connect to it.
DNS Setting
What is DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating computer services and devices worldwide. The Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.
What is the DNS of ClassicTech?
Primary DNS: 202.94.66.2
Secondary DNS: 202.94.66.3
How can I set DNS to my Phone?
GoTo Wifi setting long tap or click to i button of Connected wifi host
Click advance then set your Ip to manual/static.
Change DNS 1 to 202.94.66.2
Change DNS 2 to 202.94.66.3

Classic Tech operates a scalable and secured network that employs Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) over a Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) platform.Classic Tech has deployed metro fiber route mile infrastructure over which it offers Ethernet services at speeds up to 1 Gbps.
MPLS/VPLS
Classic Tech has MPLS as its core backbone for the Internet and intranet connectivity. MPLS is the fastest switching technology, which is typically run by ISP/NSPs for the faster packet switching process. MPLS enables Network Service Providers to offer various kinds of services to the enterprises. There can be multiple options for MPLS circuit that an enterprise can own for the intranet connectivity. Classic Tech has been expanding its redundant and reliable services throughout the country with the most popular vendor platforms like Cisco, Juniper and MikroTik for the uninterrupted services to the enterprises. The protocols used inside the cloud has capability of handling thousands of customer routes and the customers can run any addressing hierarchy as per the necessity regardless of what other customers are using as their Layer three circuit addressing.
Likewise, Classic Tech has adopted MPLS architecture due to its ability to provide multiple kinds of cost effective services that can be offered to the customers who are willing to expand their branches all over the country with redundancy and reliability.
MPLS L3VPN
MPLS Layer 3 VPNs use a peer-to-peer model that uses Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to distribute VPN-related information. This highly scalable, peer-to-peer model allows enterprise subscribers to outsource routing information to service providers, resulting in significant cost savings and a reduction in operational complexity for enterprises. Service providers can then offer value-added services like Quality of Service (QoS) and Traffic Engineering, allowing network convergence that encompasses voice, video, and data. IP-based VPNs use the next-generation Virtual Routing/Forwarding instance (VRF)-Lite, called Easy Virtual Network (EVN). This simplifies Layer 3 network virtualization and allows customers to easily provide traffic separation and path isolation on a shared network infrastructure, removing the need to deploy MPLS in the enterprise network. EVN is fully integrated with traditional MPLS-VPN or MPLS VPNomGRE.
L2VPN/VPLS
Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) emulates the behavior of a LAN across an IP or MPLS-enabled IP network allowing Ethernet devices to communicate with each other as they would when connected to a common LAN segment. As Internet service providers (ISPs) look to replace their Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) infrastructures with an IP infrastructure, there is a need for to provide standard methods of using an IP infrastructure to provide a serviceable L2 interface to customers; specifically, to provide standard ways of using an IP infrastructure to provide virtual circuits between pairs of customer sites.
Building a L2VPN system requires coordination between the ISP and the customer. The ISP provides L2 connectivity; the customer builds a network using data link resources obtained from the ISP. In an L2VPN service, the ISP does not require information about a customer’s network topology, policies, routing information,point-to-point links, or network point-to-point links from other ISPs.
The ISP requires provider edge (PE) routers with the following capabilities:
Encapsulation of L2 protocol data units (PDU) into Layer 3 (L3) packets.
Interconnection of any-to-any L2 transports.
Emulation of L2 quality-of-service (QoS) over a packet switch network.
Ease of configuration of the L2 service.
Support for different types of tunneling mechanisms (MPLS, L2TPv3, IPSec, GRE, and others).
L2VPN process databases include all information related to circuits and their connections.

Classic Tech - Best Internet In Nepal
Fair Usage Policy (FUP) - Classic Tech
Sign In
Fair Usage Policy (FUP)
What is FUP?
Fair Usage Policy or FUP is practiced by ISPs worldwide whereby it allows ISPs to restrict or throttle Internet Speeds on unlimited plans so as to prevent misuse or excessive use of bandwidth provided. FUP is implemented with the intent of protecting the ISPs’ ability to provide quality internet services to all of their customers and to ensure no customers are disadvantaged by the behavior of others.
Providing unlimited Internet service increases the risk of few customers abusing service and using most of the ISP’s bandwidth which makes it difficult for ISPs to maintain quality for other customers who have moderate usage and are paying an equal amount of money. In order to prevent this ISP throttle or restrict speeds of customers who have excessive usage so as to maintain fair usage amongst all of its customers.
How does a user fall under FUP?
Fair Usage Policy in Classic Tech is conventionally used for proper welfare and benefits for customers. Typically, FUP is used under those circumstances where few customers, using heavy data and fill up available bandwidth and making the overall experience inappropriate for other users on the same network while browsing, downloading, and gaming. Classic Tech ensures to provide the best quality internet service to our customers, where the security and privacy of our customers are protected
What happens when a user is under the influence of FUP?
If a user is under influence of FUP it is certain that the user will experience slow internet connection/slow browsing or let’s say subscribed bandwidth will be throttled as per the ISP’s rules and policy.
What factors cause the FUP? How to avoid FUP?
Classic-Tech all unlimited share plans are subjected to FUP. Most of the cases that cause FUP for a subscriber having a “Home Plan” can be:
If a user is using a “Home Plan” service for official use (for example Hostel, Cyber & Official work). Supposedly, in official use, most of the files that are downloaded and uploaded are popularized as heavy files where the use of internet bandwidth will be automatically restricted after filling up available bandwidth.
If a customer using “Home Plan” has an unusual or heavy download.
If a customer having “Home Plan” has shared a secondary link with multiple users consuming high data.
Viruses and Malicious can easily hijack devices to send and receive data without even knowing.
Subscribing to an appropriate internet plan is the best way to avoid FUP restrictions. A user can avoid FUP by keeping track of Download and Upload speed regularly. Also taking control over massive download and sharing.
How FUP works in Classic Tech?
In Classic Tech we have a Classic FUP system, which monitors our user’s behavior, when a user exceeds the monthly data threshold, Zone will be tagged automatically and on the basis of ZONE tagged, our system automatically restricts those abusers and keeps the overall experience balanced for normal users.
How does the ZONE system work in Classic Tech?
The Classic Tech system automatically checks on a user’s data usage and triggers the FUP zone if a user crosses the daily download limit. ZONES are categorized into three different types 1. YELLOW Zone 2. RED Zone & 3. BLACK Zone.
How does each zone work and what happens if a user is tagged by each zone?
As we know, zones are triggered automatically and three zones of speed throttling are done depending on the client’s usage within a monthly billing cycle.
YELLOW Zone:
Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled up to 50%; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
RED Zone:
Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled up to 25%; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
BLACK Zone:
Fair Usage Quota threshold the client’s speed will be throttled to 10% or 5 Mbps; they will be notified via SMS/EMAIL/Notification in mobile apps.
If a customer has crossed the FUP Quota threshold, their data usage counter will reset at the first of every monthly billing cycle and their Internet will return back to its original speed.
How to restart and remove FUP?
The replenishment sequence of the Data Allowance is based upon 30 days (month). At the start of the next monthly billing cycle, the customer’s subscribed speed & data transfer limit is automatically being restored as per the plan subscribed.
Other than this customers can also consider upgrading their plan so as to get higher Fair Usage Quotas or subscribe to our Enterprise/SOHO (Small Office and Home Office) plans which have no Fair Usage Quota.
